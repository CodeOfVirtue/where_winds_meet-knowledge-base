# Stat Priority & Build Impact

This section translates the damage formula into practical stat priorities.

Topics include:
- Which stats contribute most to damage and why
- How stat value changes with level caps and gear progression
- Differences in priority for DPS, tanks, and healers (high-level)
- Why some stats look strong on paper but scale poorly

This section focuses on **decision-making**, not raw math.
