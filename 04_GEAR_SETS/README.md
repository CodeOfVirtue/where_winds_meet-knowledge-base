This section documents weapon and armor set bonuses and explains their practical use.

Topics include:

- Why some sets are strong early but fall off later
- Why CN players favor certain sets at stat caps
- Conditions required for set bonuses to outperform alternatives

This is not a tier list, but a context-driven analysis.
