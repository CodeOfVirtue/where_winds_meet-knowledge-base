# Game Mechanics Explained – Overview

This section exists to **explain how the game actually works**, beyond what the UI and in-game descriptions communicate.

*Where Winds Meet* contains a large number of systems, activities, menus, and mechanics that are:
- Poorly explained
- Deeply nested in the UI
- Disconnected from their practical impact
- Easy to miss entirely

As a result, many players:
- Do not know where to find important features
- Misunderstand what certain systems are for
- Make suboptimal or frustrating decisions
- Miss out on rewards, progression paths, or mechanics altogether

This section is part of a broader **knowledge base** intended to fix that.

## What This Section Is For

The purpose of this section is to:

- Explain **game mechanics** in clear, plain language  
- Explain **UI and menu mechanics**, including where things are hidden  
- Show how different systems **connect to each other**  
- Reduce confusion caused by layered menus and vague descriptions  

This is not a theory section and not a build guide.  
It is a **practical orientation layer** for understanding the game.

## Two Core Pillars of This Section

This section covers **two distinct but related domains**:

### 1️⃣ Game Mechanics

These are systems that define *what you can do* in the game.

Examples include:
- Mini-games
- Event activities
- Ongoing side systems
- Special interactions or progression mechanics
- Currency usage and acquisition
- Activity-based rewards

Each mechanic will typically explain:
- What the system is
- When and why it matters
- Whether it is optional or important
- How it connects to other gameplay loops

---

### 2️⃣ UI & Menu Mechanics

These explain *where things are* and *how to access them*.

This is necessary because:
- Many features are hidden several layers deep
- Menu logic is often inconsistent
- Important systems are not surfaced clearly
- The same activity may appear in multiple places

UI explanations focus on:
- Where to find a feature in the menus
- Which menu paths lead to which systems
- What each menu actually represents
- Common points of confusion

These notes are intentionally **descriptive**, not judgmental.

## Why This Section Is Separate From Others

This section does **not** explain damage formulas, stat math, or optimization logic.

Those topics are handled in dedicated sections such as:
- Damage Formula
- Penetration & External Defense
- Stat Scaling
- Build Analysis

Instead, this section answers questions like:
- “Where do I even find this?”
- “What is this menu for?”
- “Why does this activity exist?”
- “Is this worth doing?”
- “How does this connect to other systems?”

It acts as the **bridge between mechanics and understanding**.

---

## How This Section Is Structured

This folder will grow over time and contain:

- A central README (this file)
- Individual notes for:
  - Specific mechanics
  - Specific UI paths
  - Specific activities or systems
- Supporting materials such as:
  - Screenshots
  - Annotated images
  - Step-by-step navigation guides

As new notes are added, this README will be updated with **references and links** to those explanations.

---

## Intended Audience

This section is designed for:

- New players overwhelmed by the UI
- Returning players who missed systems
- Players who want to understand the game holistically
- Anyone frustrated by “hidden” mechanics
- Players trying to make informed decisions

It assumes **no prior system knowledge**.

---

## How to Use This Section

Recommended approach:

1. Use this section when something feels confusing or inaccessible  
2. Look up the relevant mechanic or UI explanation  
3. Understand what it is and where it lives  
4. Move on to deeper sections only if needed  

This section is meant to reduce friction, not add complexity.

---

## Scope & Philosophy

This section aims to be:
- Clear
- Descriptive
- Practical
- Navigable
- Expandable

It does **not** aim to:
- Min-max
- Theorycraft
- Replace official documentation
- Judge player choices

Its role is orientation and clarity.

---

## Summary

- This section explains **how game and UI systems work**
- It exists because the game does not explain them well
- It separates *mechanical meaning* from *mathematical depth*
- It will grow alongside the rest of the knowledge base
- It is the starting point for understanding hidden systems

Future notes will build on this foundation.
