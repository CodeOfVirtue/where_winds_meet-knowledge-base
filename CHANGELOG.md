## 📅 2025-12-18 — Initial Research Baseline & Repository Setup

### Added
- Established the foundational structure for a long-term research repository documenting *Where Winds Meet* combat mechanics.
- Added global documentation files:
  - General project README
  - Disclaimer clarifying experimental and community-driven nature of findings
  - MIT License for original documentation and tooling
  - Third-party notice separating original work from external sources
- Created an index section with:
  - Central navigation README
  - Glossary for CN ↔ EN terminology alignment
  - Sources master list to track all primary and secondary references

### Damage Formula Research (Section 01)
- Added initial documentation of the damage calculation model based on:
  - Community testing
  - CN forum posts
  - Translated spreadsheets
- Introduced:
  - High-level overview of damage construction
  - Explanation of hit types (critical, affinity, precision, abrasion)
  - Early mathematical model of damage calculation
  - Preliminary discussion of penetration and external defense
- All material in this section is explicitly marked as **provisional** and subject to revision.

### Penetration & External Defense (Section 02)
- Scaffolded a dedicated section to expand on:
  - Hidden mitigation layers inferred from CN sources
  - Penetration scaling behavior
  - Differences between visible defense and boss mitigation
- Initial notes created; detailed validation pending.

### Additional Sections
- Created placeholder documentation for:
  - Stat priority and build theory
  - Gear set evaluation
  - Spreadsheet usage guide
  - Maps and completion resources
- These sections currently define scope and intent only.

### External Resources
- Identified and archived:
  - A translated community damage calculator (English)
  - The original Chinese damage calculator in both simplified and expanded forms  
    (Translation and verification pending.)
- Collected original CN forum discussions (e.g. NGA) as primary references.

### Changed
- ❌ Removed SOHU.com as a source after verification:
  - Determined to be a non-original aggregation
  - Lacked attribution to the original author
  - Provided incomplete and unreliable excerpts
- Source list now prioritizes **original CN posts and first-hand materials only**.

### Notes
- This entry represents a **baseline setup**, not finalized conclusions.
- Several assumptions—especially around external defense and penetration—are known to be incomplete and will be revised as translation and testing continue.
- All content reflects the state of research as of **18 December 2025**.
